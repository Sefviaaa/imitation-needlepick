# Imitation Learning for Needle Pick Task using SurRoL

This repository contains the source code and experimental results of my project on **Imitation Learning** applied to the **Needle Pick** surgical task using the **SurRoL** (Surgical Robot Learning) environment.

## Credits

This project builds upon and gives credit to [SurRoL](https://github.com/med-air/SurRoL):  
**"[IROS'21] SurRoL: An Open-source Reinforcement Learning Centered and dVRK Compatible Platform for Surgical Robot Learning"**  
We acknowledge the contributions of the SurRoL team and their open-source RL platform for surgical robot learning.

## üìå Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare multiple imitation learning models for automating the needle pick task in a simulated surgical environment. The project involves expert demonstration collection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and final evaluation using the **Success Rate and Episode Return** metric.

---

## üß™ Methodology

### üóÇ Dataset Collection

- Expert demonstrations were collected from the SurRoL environment using the built-in oracle controller:
  - `100-episodes/`
  - `2000-episodes/`

---

### üîß Model Training

Six models were trained and evaluated:

 1Ô∏è‚É£ MLP | Behavior Cloning using Multilayer Perceptron 
 2Ô∏è‚É£ LSTM | Behavior Cloning using Long Short-Term Memory 
 3Ô∏è‚É£ DAgger MLP | DAgger algorithm using MLP 
 4Ô∏è‚É£ DAgger MLP (Tuned) | DAgger MLP with tuning 
 5Ô∏è‚É£ DAgger LSTM | DAgger algorithm using LSTM 
 6Ô∏è‚É£ DAgger LSTM (Tuned) | DAgger LSTM with tuning 

Each model undergoes **grid search** over hyperparameters:
- Learning rate
- Hidden size
- Batch size
- Epochs
- Number of layers

The best configuration is selected based on **Success Rate and Episode Return** on the Needle Pick environment.



### üîÅ Final Evaluation

- After hyperparameter tuning, all six models were **re-trained using the best configuration** with **5 different random seeds**.
- Models were then evaluated on the SurRoL environment to compare performance.

## üìä Evaluation Metric

The primary evaluation metric is:

**‚úÖ Success Rate** =  
Number of successful episodes / Total evaluation episodes √ó 100%

---

## üíª Environment

- Python 3.8+
- SurRoL (Surgical Robot Learning)
- PyTorch
- Gym / Gymnasium
- Stable-Baselines3
